## üõ† Technical Implementation

### Architecture Patterns

**Component Structure**:

- Each example follows React best practices
- Separation of concerns between logic and presentation
- Reusable components and hooks
- Proper state management

**PixiJS Integration**:

- Uses `@pixi/react` for seamless React integration
- Custom drawing functions with `useCallback` for performance
- Event handling for user interactions
- Animation loops with `useTick` hook

**Performance Optimizations**:

- Memoized drawing functions
- Efficient re-rendering strategies
- Smooth animations with delta time
- Proper cleanup of event listeners

### Key Technologies

- **React 19**: Latest React features and hooks
- **PixiJS 8**: High-performance 2D rendering
- **@pixi/react**: React integration for PixiJS
- **Vite**: Fast development and building
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling

## üìä Performance Considerations

### Rendering Optimization

- Use `useCallback` for drawing functions
- Minimize re-renders with proper dependency arrays
- Implement efficient animation loops
- Use PixiJS's built-in optimization features

### Memory Management

- Clean up event listeners in `useEffect`
- Properly dispose of PixiJS objects
- Avoid memory leaks in animation loops
- Use refs for direct PixiJS object access

### User Experience

- Smooth animations with consistent frame rates
- Responsive design for different screen sizes
- Accessible interactions and keyboard support
- Loading states for better perceived performance

## üé® Customization Guide

### Styling

- Colors can be customized using hex values
- Typography uses PixiJS TextStyle for consistency
- Layout follows responsive design principles
- Professional color schemes for business applications

### Animation

- Animation speeds can be adjusted via delta multipliers
- Easing functions can be added for smoother transitions
- Custom animation patterns can be implemented
- Performance can be tuned based on requirements

### Data Integration

- Examples use mock data but can be easily connected to APIs
- State management can be enhanced with Redux or Zustand
- Real-time updates can be implemented with WebSockets
- Data validation and error handling can be added
